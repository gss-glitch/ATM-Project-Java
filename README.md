# ATM-Project-Java
This project is a web-based ATM simulation system developed using the Spring Framework (Spring Core + Spring MVC). It provides core banking operations such as account creation, balance check, deposit, withdrawal, and account detail management. The application follows the MVC architecture, uses dependency injection, and demonstrates key Spring features like IoC containers and annotations. It offers a clean and modular backend structure, making it easy to extend or integrate with databases or front-end technologies.
